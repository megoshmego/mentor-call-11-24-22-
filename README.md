Thank you for helping me!

project that I have named "myJQuery", which is a combination of bootstrap and jquery for the exercise in section four of the Sprinboard SWE career track
is what prompted me to reach out for a mentoring session.  Below is the instruction.

"Part Two - Movies App!
Build an application that uses jQuery to do the following:

Contains a form with two inputs for a title and rating along with a button to submit the form.
When the form is submitted, capture the values for each of the inputs and append them to the DOM along with a button to remove each title and rating from the DOM.
When the button to remove is clicked, remove each title and rating from the DOM."


The solution provided by springboard created a table for displaying the movie data. I have included that file as well, naming it "sprinboardJQuery". In an attempt to practice on my own, I 
was using an unordered list to display the movie data, and my solution is not working.  I think it is indicative of a bigger problem I am having with understanding 
when to declare variables for appending, as well as when using hoisting is appropriate.  I have included another file that is composed of random snippets from projects 
that I also found problematic and could help clarify where my lack of understanding is. Comments for clarification are commented out in all files. Thank you!
